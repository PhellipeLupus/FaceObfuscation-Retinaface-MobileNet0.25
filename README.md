# VideoBlurring-RetinaFace

This repository provides a light-weight video blurring implementation, based on RetinaFace with a MobileNet0.25 backbone.
In the notebook file "FaceDetect.ipynb", the implementation can be found. At the bottom of the file an example can be found of the blurring prosess, with an example avi file.

OpenCV, Pytorch version 1.1.0+ and torchvision 0.3.0+ are needed.
